## üñåÔ∏è Overview  

Stardock Fences is a utility created to help users keep their desktops neat and organized by grouping icons into customizable areas. Instead of a cluttered screen full of shortcuts, you can arrange everything into visually distinct sections for quick and easy access.  

One of the program‚Äôs strengths lies in its ability to automatically sort new icons into designated categories. For example, you can set rules so that downloaded files, office shortcuts, or games each appear in their own fenced area. This keeps your desktop tidy without constant manual effort.  

Fences also supports collapsing and expanding groups, giving you more space when you need it. With a simple double-click, you can hide less important icons and keep only what‚Äôs essential visible. This makes it easier to focus on your work or entertainment without distraction.  

The software offers a variety of customization options, from changing colors and transparency to adjusting layouts. You can personalize your desktop so it not only functions well but also matches your style or theme.  

Another valuable feature is the roll-up option, where fences minimize to a title bar until you hover over them. This ensures your workspace remains uncluttered while still giving you quick access to everything you need.  

Performance-wise, Stardock Fences is lightweight and efficient, running smoothly in the background without affecting system resources. It is designed to enhance productivity while keeping Windows fast and responsive.  

The tool is compatible with both Windows 10 and Windows 11, making it a versatile choice for users on different versions of the OS. Updates continue to improve stability and expand customization options based on user feedback.  

Overall, Stardock Fences transforms a messy desktop into a clean, structured workspace. By combining automation, personalization, and usability, it helps users stay organized and more productive throughout their day.
